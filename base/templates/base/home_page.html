                    <hr>
                    <p>
                        I was born in Vietnam and immigrated to the United States 6 years ago. I then attended U.S High School for 2 years and went 
                        to John Tyler Community College to study Engineering. Back then, I did not know which type of specific engineering that
                        I want to pursue. However, as I took different engineering courses such as EE, ME, CpE, and CS; I fell in love with 
                        programming and decided to major in Computer Science. I studied there for 2 years and then joined UVA
                        as their third-year Computer Science student. Since then, I developed a lot of technical skills as I worked on multiple programming assignments in school as well as my personal 
                        project. In the past, I collaborated with other engineering students to develop Virtual Buddy Finder App where students can meet up and study virtually. Specifically, I was in charge
                        of integrating Google Log-in as well as Google Calendar and implementing student profile page in the app. In the future, I am interested in joining tech company as a Software Engineer to learn 
                        more about this field from others, expand my knowledge in Computer Science, and contribute building helpful technology for society. In my free time, I love to eat, play game, listen to music,
                        draw, and watch anime
